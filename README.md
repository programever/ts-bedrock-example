# üí´ The motivation comes from **Functional Programming (FP)** and **Type-Driven Development (TDD)**.

## üß™ What is Type-Driven Development (TDD), and How Does it Help?

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This section refers to **Type-Driven Development**, not traditional Test-Driven Development.

Type-Driven Development is a design-first approach where we define the **types before the implementation**. It treats the type system as the first line of defense against bugs‚Äîshifting correctness from runtime to compile time.

Instead of writing tests to confirm what the code does, we **encode correctness directly into the types**, making invalid states unrepresentable.

### üîë Core Ideas

- **Start with types**: Define the domain first using `type`, `union`, and structured data‚Äîso that the shape of the problem is encoded in the type system.
- **Use ADTs (algebraic data types)**: Represent state and behavior explicitly using types like `Maybe`, `Result`, `RemoteData`, and `Opaque`. These make edge cases and failures impossible to ignore.
- **Parse at the boundaries**: Convert all external data (e.g., from forms, APIs, files) into trusted domain types before using them. This ensures internal logic never operates on unknown or invalid data.
- **Let the compiler guide you**: Type errors become your to-do list‚Äîshowing exactly where logic is incomplete or unsafe during development and refactoring.
- **Types as documentation**: Function signatures act as clear, enforceable contracts‚Äîfor both implementers and reviewers‚Äîreducing ambiguity and miscommunication.

### ‚úÖ Benefits

- **Types describe business logic**  
Types don‚Äôt just shape data‚Äîthey express the **intent** and rules of your domain, making your code easier to reason about.  
_Example: `type Email = string & { readonly brand: unique symbol }` makes it clear this is not just any string‚Äîit must be validated as an email. This approach is even better with a Generic Opaque Type Opaque<string, typeof emailUniqueSymbol>_

---

- **Function contracts become clear**  
Typed function signatures clearly communicate expectations and outcomes‚Äîboth to the implementer and future reviewers.  
_Example: `function login(email: Email, password: Password): Result<AuthError, Session>` makes the success and failure paths explicit‚Äîthe caller is required to handle both, leading to clearer, safer control flow._

---

- **Types evolve with requirements**  
As business needs change, the type system helps **track and adapt** those changes across the entire codebase.  
_Example: A common design might add `isSuspended: boolean` to `User`, but this only tells us whether the user is suspended or not‚Äînothing can be extended further in the future. Evolving this to a richer model like `suspensionStatus: { _t: 'None' } | { _t: 'Suspended'; reason: string } | { _t: 'InReview'; reviewerId: UserId }` Requirements can be extended._

---

- **Edge cases are modeled explicitly**  
Instead of being forgotten or handled implicitly, unusual or error states are **designed into** the system from the start.  
_Example: Using `RemoteData<Error, Data>` instead of a mix of `isLoading`, `error`, and `data` booleans prevents impossible UI states like ‚Äúloading: false, error: null, data: null‚Äù by modeling them as mutually exclusive._

---

- **Immediate feedback loop**  
Type errors are surfaced **at development time**, enabling faster iteration without waiting for runtime or test failures.  
_Example: When adding currency to `Product`, instead of just adding `currency: 'USD' | 'EUR'`, we replace `price: number` with `pricing: { amount: number; currency: 'USD' | 'EUR' }`. This forces the compiler to flag every usage of `price`, giving us a tight feedback loop to safely update the entire codebase._

---

- **Refactor with confidence**  
Type safety ensures that structural changes are **safe to apply**‚Äîif it compiles, it likely works.  
_Example: Suppose `User` originally had `phone: Phone`, but we never validated it as non-null when decoding the API response. Later, business rules change and require every user to have at least one phone number‚Äîso we want to refactor to `phones: NonEmptyArray<Phone>`. But because the original data shape was never trusted, we can't safely make that change. If we had enforced decoding upfront, the compiler would now let us evolve with confidence._

---

- **Parse, don‚Äôt validate**  
On the frontend, each form field should act as a parser‚Äînot just a string with a validation flag. Instead of validating manually with `boolean` checks, we model each field as a structured value that either contains an error or a usable result.
_Example: Instead of `email: string`, we use `email: Field<EmailError, Email>`. Traditional validation returns a `boolean`, which tells us whether something is valid‚Äîbut gives us no usable data. Parsing returns a `Result<EmailError, Email>`, which either provides an error to display or a typed value we can safely pass upstream._

---

- **Better developer experience**  
Type-Driven Development improves how developers write, review, and collaborate around code. Types encode the business rules directly‚Äîso developers don‚Äôt have to reverse-engineer intent from implementation.
_Example: `function placeOrder(cart: NonEmptyArray<Item>, user: AuthenticatedUser): Result<OutOfStock | PaymentDeclined, OrderConfirmation>`_
_- From the writer‚Äôs perspective, the function signature makes it clear what needs to be handled: only authenticated users can place orders, carts must not be empty, and the function must account for both out-of-stock and payment failure scenarios._
_- From the reviewer‚Äôs perspective, the signature communicates the full contract: what‚Äôs required, what can go wrong, and what success looks like‚Äîwithout reading the implementation. Review becomes focused on logic and correctness, not guesswork._

---

- **Fewer tests required**  
Well-designed types remove the need for many low-value unit tests that merely confirm type shape or control flow.  
_Example: A legacy codebase might include tests like ‚Äúshould return a default if name is missing.‚Äù But with well-modeled types‚Äîsuch as `name: Maybe<NonEmptyString>`‚Äîthe absence of a name becomes an explicit case you must handle. Since the type enforces this possibility at compile time, there‚Äôs no need for defensive tests that merely confirm null-checking logic._

---

- **Higher trust in the system**  
With logic and correctness encoded in the type system, your codebase becomes **self-validating and more resilient** over time.  
_Example: When onboarding a new developer, they can confidently work with `User`, `Session`, or `Order` types without reading every implementation detail‚Äîbecause the domain logic is captured in the type structure itself. This builds trust across the team: if the types align, the code aligns._

### ü§ù Relationship with Testing

Type-Driven Development doesn‚Äôt eliminate tests‚Äîit **shifts their focus**:

- **Types** validate structure and logic paths.
- **Tests** focus on runtime behaviors, edge cases, and external I/O (APIs, DB, file systems).

This approach is particularly effective when combined with Functional Programming, which we‚Äôll explore in the next section.

## üß† What is Functional Programming (FP), and Why Does it Work Well with TDD?

FP is a paradigm that emphasizes **predictable behavior**, **explicit state**, and **compositional logic**. It encourages writing small, pure functions that are easy to reason about and free from hidden side effects.

**FP and TDD reinforce each other**: FP ensures that data and behavior are predictable, while TDD enforces those guarantees at compile time. Together, they create powerful feedback loops that drive confidence, clarity, and long-term maintainability.

### üîß Core FP Principles

- **Pure functions**: A function‚Äôs output depends only on its input. No hidden state or side effects.
- **Immutability**: Values are never mutated‚Äînew values are derived from old ones.
- **Algebraic Data Types (ADTs)**: Types like `Maybe`, `Result`, and tagged unions help represent possible states and make edge cases explicit.
- **Composition**: Small functions are combined into larger behavior through composition, reducing complexity and duplication.
- **First-class types**: Data modeling and function signatures reflect domain logic directly‚Äîenabling strong compiler guarantees.
- **Out of scope**: Advanced patterns like Type Classes are not discussed in this context to keep the focus practical and accessible.

### ü§ù Why FP Fits TDD Perfectly

- **Shared focus on types**: Both FP and TDD treat types as first-class citizens, using them to encode business rules and prevent invalid states by design.
- **Explicit control flow**: FP uses ADTs like `Result` and `Maybe` to make success/failure paths unmissable‚Äîexactly what TDD needs to shift correctness to compile time.
- **Composable logic**: TDD thrives when logic is isolated and predictable. FP encourages composition of pure, focused functions that are easy to reason about and test.
- **No hidden behavior**: FP discourages mutation and side effects, making type-driven guarantees more trustworthy and reliable.
- **Type-safe boundaries**: FP‚Äôs emphasis on keeping effects and I/O at the edge reinforces the TDD pattern of ‚Äúparse first, trust later.‚Äù

### ‚úÖ Example
```ts
// Core types
type Result<E, A> = { _t: "Ok"; value: A } | { _t: "Err"; error: E }

const Result = {
  ok: <A>(value: A): Result<never, A> => ({ _t: "Ok", value }),
  err: <E>(error: E): Result<E, never> => ({ _t: "Err", error }),
}

type Task<E, A> = Promise<Result<E, A>>

type Opaque<T> = T // Should be properly defined in the real code, but not for this example

type PositiveInteger = Opaque<number>

// App types

type UserID = PositiveInt
type Email = Opaque<string>
type Password = Opaque<string>
type JWTToken = Opaque<string>

type SignupParams = { email: string; password: string }
type ParsedParams = { email: Email; passwordHash: Password }
type User = { id: UserID; email: Email }
type UserWithJWT = User & { token: JWTToken }

type ParamsParserError = { _t: "ParamsParserError"; message: string }
type EmailTakenError = { _t: "EmailTakenError" }
type DbError = { _t: "DbError"; reason: string }
type JWTError = { _t: "JWTError"; reason: string }
type MailingError = { _t: "MailingError"; reason: string }

type SignupError =
  | ParamsParserError
  | EmailTakenError
  | DbError
  | JWTError
  | MailingError

// App logics
function parseSignupInput(
  params: SignupParams,
): Result<ParamsParserError, ParsedParams> {
  if (!params.email.includes("@")) {
    return Result.err({ _t: "ParamsParserError", message: "Invalid email" })
  }
  return Result.ok({
    email: params.email,
    passwordHash: "hashed-" + params.password,
  })
}

function checkEmailUnique(
  params: ParsedParams,
): Task<EmailTakenError, ParsedParams> {
  return params.email === "taken@example.com"
    ? Promise.resolve(
        Result.err({ _t: "EmailTakenError", email: params.email }),
      )
    : Promise.resolve(Result.ok(params))
}

async function saveUser(params: ParsedParams): Task<DbError, User> {
  return Promise.resolve(Result.ok({ id: 123, email: params.email }))
}

function generateJWT(user: User): Result<JWTError, UserWithJWT> {
  return Result.ok({ ...user, token: "jwt-token" })
}

async function sendWelcomeEmail(user: User): Task<MailingError, User> {
  return Promise.resolve(Result.ok(user))
}

// App handlers
async function signupEmail(
  params: SignupParams,
): Task<SignupError, UserWithJWT> {
  const parsed = parseSignupInput(params)
  if (parsed._t === "Err") return parsed

  const unique = await checkEmailUnique(parsed.value)
  if (unique._t === "Err") return unique

  const user = await saveUser(unique.value)
  if (user._t === "Err") return user

  const [userWithJWT, _] = await Promise.all([
    generateJWT(user.value),
    sendWelcomeEmail(user.value),
  ])

  return userWithJWT
}
```
### üéì Slide Summary: What This Signup Example Shows
#### ‚úÖ `Result<E, A>` = Success or Failure by Design
```ts
type Result<E, A> = { _t: "Ok"; value: A } | { _t: "Err"; error: E }
```
-   No try/catch
-   No null/undefined
-   No surprises
    
üëâ Failures are **typed and expected**

----------

#### ‚úÖ `Task<E, A>` = Async with Structural Guarantees
```ts
type Task<E, A> = Promise<Result<E, A>>
```
-   Forces error handling
-   Composes with async    
-   Makes `Promise` safe

üëâ Every await includes an outcome you must handle

----------

#### ‚úÖ Opaque Types = Trust by the Type System
```ts
// This is one of Opaque version:
export type Opaque<T, K extends symbol, Unwrapped = T> = {
  [key in K]: T
} & {
  readonly unwrap: () => Unwrapped
  readonly toJSON: () => JSONValue
}
type Email = Opaque<string, typeof unique symbol>
type JWTToken = Opaque<string, typeof unique symbol>
```
-   Raw strings can‚Äôt sneak in
-   Only validated values pass through    
-   Domain modeling at compile time

üëâ "If it's not validated, it's not an `Email`"

----------

#### ‚úÖ Small Pure Functions = Predictable Building Blocks
```ts
parseSignupInput ‚Üí checkEmailUnique ‚Üí saveUser ‚Üí generateJWT ‚Üí sendWelcomeEmail
```
-   Reusable
-   Independently testable
-   Explicit input/output types

üëâ No state. No mutation. No hidden behavior.

----------

#### ‚úÖ Flow is Linear, Typed, and Type-Safe
```ts
async function signupEmail(...) {
  const parsed = parseSignupInput(...)
  if (parsed._t === "Err") return parsed
  ...
}
```
-   No branching hell
-   No `if (this && that && maybe)` madness
-   Early return on failure

üëâ **Type-safe control flow** without ceremony

## üöÄ How Do We Apply This in Real-World Projects?

Applying Type-Driven Development and Functional Programming effectively means enforcing safety and consistency through tooling and team discipline.

Here are the 9 most important enablers:

----------

### 1. ‚úÖ Use `tsc` Strict Mode
-   Must enable `strict`, `strictNullChecks`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`, `noImplicitAny`
-   `tsc --noEmit` should run in CI and ideally in pre-commit
-   Type errors should be treated as **bugs**, not ‚Äúwon‚Äôt fix‚Äù

----------

### 2. üö´ Ban `any`, `is`, `as`, and `!`
-   These escape hatches disable type safety
-   Use decoders, opaque types, and Result/Option instead
-   If you must assert, isolate it to boundary parsing and document clearly

----------

### 3. üìè Enforce Style with ESLint + Prettier

-   Use `@typescript-eslint` with strict rules
-   Add `eslint-plugin-functional` to enforce immutability and purity
-   Format all code automatically with Prettier to eliminate style noise

----------

### 4. üß† Use Opaque Types for Domain Data

-   Wrap primitives like `string`, `number`, etc., in branded types:
    ```ts
    type Email = Opaque<string, 'Email'>
    type UserID = Opaque<number, 'UserID'>
    
    ```
-   Ensures no raw values are passed without validation
-   Makes types more descriptive and misuse impossible

----------

### 5. ‚õî Never Return Raw Promises

-   Don‚Äôt use `Promise<T>` in business logic
-   Use `Task<E, A> = Promise<Result<E, A>>` instead
-   Every async function must return a `Result` so failures are handled structurally

----------

### 6. üß™ Parse Before You Trust (Decoders Everywhere)

-   Parse all input: form data, API response, URL params, config, etc.
-   Use `decoders`, `zod` or a custom parser
-   Never operate on unvalidated input

----------

### 7. üéØ Model Failures and Options as Types

-   No more `null`, `undefined`, or `boolean isError`
-   Use:
    -   `Maybe<T>` instead of `T | null`
    -   `Result<E, A>` instead of try/catch
    -   `RemoteData<E, A>` for loading/idle/error/success

----------

### 8. üîÅ Keep Effects at the Edge

-   Side effects (fetch, DB, etc.) should only happen in `Task<E, A>` layers
-   Core logic must be pure and testable

----------

### 9. üßº Pure Functions Only in Domain Logic

-   No `class`, no `new`, no mutation
-   Domain logic = pure functions + ADTs
-   Business logic should be:
    -   Composable
    -   Referentially transparent
    -   Easy to test and refactor
